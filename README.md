# tasty-tom-s  

This is a project based off of Wes Bos's React for Beginners.  This is not my code.  It only shows my understanding of the content of the course.  

E commerce web app built with React featuring store menu, order form & inventory management. Please note this is an unfinished work in progress.
• Coded in React to preserve live inventory & reflect changes without page reload
• Used localStorage to reinstate customer's current order info across sessions • Built inventory interface to allow store owner to login & make any changes
