        "A Delicious Galactic Beauty-- With mottled skin resembling a scene from deep space, each fascinating fruit depicts the depth and beauty of the night sky. Dark Galaxy bears 2-8 ounce fruits that are flattened, with red and orange stripes covered in random speckles, and layered by deep blue. The vines themselves display a purple blush and grow 5-6 feet tall while producing good amounts of the stunning tomatoes that begin to ripen in about 75 days. The taste is a perfect balance of tangy-sweetness--so juicy and refreshing! Each fruit is a unique work of art, sure to be a garden and tabletop centerpiece! Another stunning tomato from Brad Gates.",

        "80 days. This Brad Gates selection is an absolute masterpiece! Winner of the sweetest tomato award at the 2017 National Heirloom Expo. A slicing-type with stunning fruits, inside and out! This sister selection to Blue Beauty yields loads of 5-ounce, beefsteak- type fruits, very meaty and containing very few seeds. First they ripen yellow, then more toward orange when very ripe. Incredibly attractive with the black anthocyanin splashes really contrasting with the lighter colored skin. The sweet, juicy flesh is marbled yellow to red, and the flavor is fruity and superb. Unusually heat-tolerant; the fruits are great keepers. You can’t go wrong with this one!",

Flesh is bright green and very rich tasting, sweet with a sharp bite to it (just too good to describe!). A favorite tomato of many high class chefs, specialty markets, and home gardeners. Yield is excellent. The most striking tomato in our catalog, a real beauty. Around 3 ounces. This is the tomato colored for the Green Bay Packers.",

It was passed down to him from his Quaker grandfather’s collection dating back to the 1920s. As to its history, Will states “The ‘true’ Black Brandywine was bred sometime in the late 1920s by Dr. Harold E. Martin (1888-1959), a dentist turned plant breeder who is best remembered today for his famous pole lima with huge seeds.",

So dark that some tomatoes turn solid blue-black on the skin. Deep red flesh is among the best tasting of all tomatoes. Rich, smooth and savory with earthy tones. Hangs well on the vine and stores very well, and the flavor improves with room-temperature storage. Our own Dave Kaiser tasted it at the 2015 National Heirloom Exposition and proclaimed it as the BEST tomato he had ever eaten!",

Lavishly pleated fruits come in all sizes up to 6 ounces, sometimes a bit more. The name means “toothed” in German, and slices certainly present this appearance. Semi-hollow fruit are firm and mild-tasting; great for stuffing. Very productive, even in hot, dry condition.",
